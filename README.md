# rea-lists
C++ lists and base class with c strings, no STL
This is a library I created before the STL came about, it has classes similar to 
list and string (in the STL). There is a base class called "vbc_link" that is used in 
the lists. There is provision for static class numbering, polymorphic IO and
persistence. 
My reason for posting this is to provide it for programs I have written, and
for people who want to experiment with persistence and polymorphic IO using
inheritance. This is classic object oriented programming.
The makefile assumes the existence of ~/include, ~/lib and ~/bin.
I intend to add more programs to this repository showing the use of this
library.
