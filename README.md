# rea-lists
C++ doubly linked list class, base class, c string class

This is a heirarchical class library with polymorphic IO and static class
numbering. There is a base class called "vbc_link" that is the root of
the heirarchy of classes.   

This library was created to allow experimenting with persistence afforded by 
polymorphic IO using inheritance and static class numbering. This is classic 
object oriented programming.

The makefile assumes the existence of ~/include, ~/lib and ~/bin.

I am including sample programs that automate C++ code development.

gencla: this program creates class libs

genpgm: this program uses list classes and creates a program skeleton with
file IO
