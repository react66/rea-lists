# rea-lists
C++ lists and base class with c strings, no STL
This is a library I created before the STL came about, it has classes similar to 
list and string (in the STL). There is a base class called "link" that is used in 
the lists. There is provision for static class numbering, polymorphic IO and
persistence. 
My reason for posting this is to provide it for programs I have written, I 
recommend using the STL for new programs.
